## Introduction

This presentation covers the winning solution by team "Cameron" for the Presumed Open Data: Data Science Challenge. It will focus on:

1. training data
2. feature engineering
3. forecasting models
4. scheduling methodology.

A short example for one of the competition forecast dates will be presented at the end.


## Data used

\small

Data | Interval | In horizon? | Used?
-------|----------|--------------------------------|-------
Electricity demand | Half-hourly | No | Yes
Reanalysis temperature (6 locations) | Hourly | Yes | Yes
Reanalysis irradiance (6 locations) | Hourly | Yes | Yes
Solar PV generation | Half-hourly | No | Yes
Solar irradiance data | Half-hourly | No | No
PV module temperature | Half-hourly | No | No

\normalsize

Solar irradiance and PV module temperature data collected at the solar farm were not used.

Reanalysis temperature and irradiance data were linearly interpolated to create half-hourly values.


## Methodology

Focused on producing accurate forecasts for both PV generation and electricity demand. The process for battery scheduling involved the following steps:

1. Produced deterministic forecasts for **electricity demand**.
2. Produced deterministic/probabilistic forecasts for **PV generation**.
3. **Scaled PV generation forecast** to obtain battery charging schedule.
4. Scheduled battery discharging to produce **flat evening demand** (based on forecast).


----

### Electricity demand model

* Only fitted using evening demand between 3:30pm and 9:00pm.
* Three dates removed as they appeared to be outliers.

```{r}
outlier_dates <- ymd(c("2018-05-08", "2018-05-10", "2018-11-04"))
pod %>% 
  mutate(period = hh_to_period(datetime), 
         date = date(datetime), 
         outlier = if_else(date %in% outlier_dates, T, F),
         outlier_date = if_else(outlier, as.character(date), "Inlier"),
         hhmm = hms::as_hms(datetime)) %>%
  filter(date < fcst_start_date,
         period %in% 32:42) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = hhmm, y = demand_mw, group = date,
             colour = outlier_date, alpha = outlier)) + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Evening Electricity Demand",
       colour = "Outlier date",
       x = "Time",
       y = "Demand (MW)") +
  scale_colour_manual(
    values = c(hue_pal()(3), "black")
  ) +
  scale_alpha_manual(
    values = c("TRUE" = 1, 'FALSE' = 0.1),
    guide = FALSE
  ) +
  scale_x_time(breaks = c(hms::hms(0,30,15),
                          hms::hms(0,0,18),
                          hms::hms(0,30,20)),
               labels = time_format("%H:%M"))
```

## Methodology

Trained model to predict half-hourly demand using **gradient boosted decision trees**. Implemented using `lightgbm`.

The demand model used the following features:

* half-hour period of day
* day of year
* day of week
* public holidays
* lagged demand (1-week)
* temperature and lags (1, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 96 half-hourly lags) for all 6 reanalysis locations
* solar irradiance and lags (1, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 96 half-hourly lags) for all 6 reanalysis locations
* previous day's maximum, minimum and average temperatures across all 6 reanalysis locations
* trend.

----

Highly parameterized model! Needed to take care to avoid over-fitting. Used time series cross validation to tune **number of leaves** and **learning rate** parameters. Typically used 5 "week-long" folds and RMSE to assess accuracy, but experimented throughout the competition.

## Methodology

### Probabilistic PV generation model

The PV generation model was again fit using **gradient boosted decision trees** implemented using `lightgbm`.

Originally focused on point forecasts for PV. Experimented with quantile forecasts towards the end of the competition.

The following features were used by the PV generation model:

* half-hour period of day
* month of year
* day of year
* lagged PV generation (1-week)
* temperature and lags (1, 2, ..., 6 half-hourly lags) for all 6 reanalysis locations
* solar irradiance and lags (1, 2, ..., 6 half-hourly lags) for all 6 reanalysis locations.


## Methodology

### Scheduling battery (charging)

* Scaled PV prediction so that total energy was equal to 6MWh over the allowed charging times. This served as the battery charging schedule.
  * Less charging occurs during times that are expected to have low PV generation, more charging occurs when we expect more PV generation.
* No penalty for importing from grid, so always aimed to fully charge battery.


## Methodology

### Scheduling battery (discharging)

Ideally, we want demand to be completely flat to ensure the peak has been reduced as much as possible. Needed to calculate what the new peak would be:

$$
\sum_{k=32}^{42} \hat{L}_{d,k} = L^*_d \times \underbrace{|\left\{ 32, \ldots, 42 \right\}|}_{=11} + 12
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
L^*_d = \frac{\sum_{k=32}^{42} \hat{L}_{d,k} - 12}{11},
$$
where $L^*_d$ is the new expected peak between periods 32 to 42 for day $d$ and $\hat{L}_{d,k}$ is our forecast demand.

## Methodology

From here, we can simply take the difference between the forecast electricity demand and $L^*_d$ to obtain the required discharge for each half-hourly period on day $d$:

$$
B_{d,k} = L^*_d - \hat{L}_{d,k},
$$

for $k \in \left\{ 32, \ldots, 42 \right\}$.

Note, there were some checks to ensure battery constraints weren't violated, but these didn't actually come into play over the duration of the competition â€” $B_{d,k}$ values were consistently less than 2.5MW in magnitude.

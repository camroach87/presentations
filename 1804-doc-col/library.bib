               estimating consumption for academic buildings is an ideal tool
               that balances performance and utility. Using 80 buildings from
               Ryerson University (Toronto) and the University of Toronto,
               significant building characteristics were identified that showed
               a strong linear relationship with electricity consumption. Four
               equations were created to represent the diversity in size of
               academic buildings on both campuses. Tested using
               cross-validation, the coefficient of variation of the RMSE for
               all models was 33\%, with a range of error between 20\% and
               43\%. The models were highly successful at predicting high-level
               electricity consumption at Ryerson University with an average
               error of 14.8\% for five building clusters. Using metered data
               from each cluster, raw estimates for individual buildings were
               adjusted to improve accuracy.",

              non-intrusive load monitoring techniques, NILM) to monitor the
              large number of workstations and office appliances. The key
              purpose of this study is to ascertain the applicability of using
              time series subsequence data mining to study and classify the
              transient operations of typical appliances in an office. The
              approach involves discovering hidden subsequences (i.e. feature
              extraction) that are characteristic of individual appliance
              transient states, using an extension of Symbolic Aggregate
              approXimation (SAX). Such characteristic features are used to
              create a repository of rules to help supervised classification of
              aggregate time series measurements. It is one of the first
              studies to demonstrate the potential of classifying subsequence
              features into individual appliances and their states within large
              aggregate time series data using a ``Bag of Rules'' approach. The
              results indicate that distinct, characteristic patterns represent
              office appliances and their states, in the form of SAX grammar
              rules. These patterns can then be used for NILM with promising
              results. This ongoing study demonstrates SAX based time series
              subsequence mining as a proof-of-concept; not only to discover
              similarities presented by appliance events but also to
              demonstrate their applicability to disambiguate aggregate

              Karhunen Loéve expansion to breakdown the active power signal
              into subspace components (SCs) so as to construct a unique
              information rich appliance signature. Unlike existing NILM
              techniques that rely on multiple measurements at high sampling
              rates, this method works effectively with a single active power
              measurement taken at a low sampling rate. After constructing the

              reduce the number of possible appliance combinations prior to
              applying the maximum a posteriori estimation. Then, an appliances

               rigorous statistical foundation for AIC. AIC can be justified as

  title     = "Model Selection and Multimodel Inference: A Practical
               {Information-Theoretic} Approach",
  author    = "Burnham, Kenneth P and Anderson, David R",
  abstract  = "We wrote this book to introduce graduate students and research
               workers in various scienti?c disciplines to the use of
               information-theoretic approaches in the analysis of empirical
               data. These methods allow the data-based selection of a ``best''
               model and a ranking and weighting of the remaining models in a
               pre-de?ned set. Traditional statistical inference can then be
               based on this selected best model. However, we now emphasize
               that information-theoretic approaches allow formal inference to
               be based on more than one model (m- timodel inference). Such
               procedures lead to more robust inferences in many cases, and we
               advocate these approaches throughout the book. The second
               edition was prepared with three goals in mind. First, we have
               tried to improve the presentation of the material. Boxes now
               highlight ess- tial expressions and points. Some reorganization
               has been done to improve the ?ow of concepts, and a new chapter
               has been added. Chapters 2 and 4 have been streamlined in view
               of the detailed theory provided in Chapter 7. S- ond, concepts
               related to making formal inferences from more than one model
               (multimodel inference) have been emphasized throughout the book,
               but p- ticularly in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. Third, new technical
               material has been added to Chapters 5 and 6. Well over 100 new
               references to the technical literature are given. These changes
               result primarily from our experiences while giving several
               seminars, workshops, and graduate courses on material in the
               ?rst e- tion.",

  abstract      = "Linear mixed effects models are highly flexible in handling
                   a broad range of data types and are therefore widely used in
                   applications. A key part in the analysis of data is model
                   selection, which often aims to choose a parsimonious model
                   with other desirable properties from a possibly very large
                   set of candidate statistical models. Over the last 5-10
                   years the literature on model selection in linear mixed
                   models has grown extremely rapidly. The problem is much more
                   complicated than in linear regression because selection on
                   the covariance structure is not straightforward due to
                   computational issues and boundary problems arising from
                   positive semidefinite constraints on covariance matrices. To
                   obtain a better understanding of the available methods,
                   their properties and the relationships between them, we
                   review a large body of literature on linear mixed model
                   selection. We arrange, implement, discuss and compare model
                   selection methods based on four major approaches:
                   information criteria such as AIC or BIC, shrinkage methods
                   based on penalized loss functions such as LASSO, the Fence
                   procedure and Bayesian techniques.",

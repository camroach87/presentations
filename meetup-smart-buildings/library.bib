@BOOK{Murphy2012-bc,
  title     = "Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective",
  author    = "Murphy, Kevin P",
  abstract  = "Today's Web-enabled deluge of electronic data calls for
               automated methods of data analysis. Machine learning provides
               these, developing methods that can automatically detect patterns
               in data and then use the uncovered patterns to predict future
               data. This textbook offers a comprehensive and self-contained
               introduction to the field of machine learning, based on a
               unified, probabilistic approach. The coverage combines breadth
               and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics
               as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as
               discussion of recent developments in the field, including
               conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning.
               The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete
               with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics
               are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples
               drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing,
               computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook
               of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled
               model-based approach, often using the language of graphical
               models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost
               all the models described have been implemented in a MATLAB
               software package -- PMTK (probabilistic modeling toolkit) --
               that is freely available online. The book is suitable for
               upper-level undergraduates with an introductory-level college
               math background and beginning graduate students.",
